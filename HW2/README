Matthew Warren - CSC481 HW2

I combined sections 1 and 2 into a single project, sections 3 and 4 I kept seperate. 

Section 4 should work, so for grading purposes im not sure if you will need to check section 3 but I kept it in just in case.

Each section folder has its own makefile that can be run useing "make" in the main part of the folder

section1and2's makefile will create an executable that can be run with:
./hw2exe

section 3 and 4's makefile create 2 executables that can be run like so:
./server
./client

with ./server to start the server first, and ./client can be run in up to 3 process to connect to the server to performed the desired action.

The writeup is in a pdf at the root of the submission with this README
