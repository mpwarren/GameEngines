Matthew Warren - CSC481 HW2

I combined sections 1 and 2 into a single project, sections 3 and 4 I kept seperate. 

Section 4 should work, so for grading purposes im not sure if you will need to check section 3 but I kept it in just in case.

Section 4 has multithreading but not timeline code incoperated in it.

Each section folder has its own makefile that can be run useing "make" in the main part of the folder

Player movement is done with the WASD keys

SECTION 1 and 2
the makefile will create an executable that can be run with:
./hw2exe

Pressing P will pause or unpause the game

Pressing F will run the game at 0.5x speed
Pressing G will run the game at 1x speed
pressing H will run the game at 2x speed

SECTION 3 and 4
the makefile create 2 executables that can be run like so:
./server
./client

with ./server to start the server first, and ./client can be run in up to 3 process to connect to the server to performed the desired action.

The writeup is in a pdf at the root of the submission with this README
