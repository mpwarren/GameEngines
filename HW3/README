COMPILING:
- In the parent folder, call make to compile everything

RUNNING:
- Start the server first with ./server
- Then run any clients with ./client

CONTROLS:
- A: Move Left
- D: Move right
- W: Jump
- P: Pause the game with P
- Z: 1/2x tic rate
- X: normal tic rate
- C: 2x tic rate

GAMEPLAY:
- The clients character is marked with grey, all other clients on the network are white
- Pausing will pause the game for everyone, but anyone can unpause it
- Changing the tic rate will only change it for that client's player
- All players must stay on the screen. The game will not side scroll with one player at each end
- Death zones are marked in red. Any player that hits them will reset the level
- When a networked player disconnects, it will take a few seconds to update on the other clients
